# the-next-market-leaders
Project 1 FIntech 
# Our goal is to identify the best market leaders in 2021 to add to your stock portfolio. 
# We will pull data from several companies across major industries with high growth potential for the coming year.
# We will ask questions such as what is the company's current and past revenue, gross profit, stock price and projected performance.
# From this information, we will identify industry and market leaders with potential to grow exponentially. 
# We look to provide investors with high quality companies that are projected to give high returns based on real time data.
